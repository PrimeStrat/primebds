# Hello! ![icon](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a45041b9-1de9-4384-90a3-cf2505f4da24)

This is PrimeBDS, an essentials plugin for diagnostics, stability, and quality of life on Minecraft Bedrock Edition.
This plugin runs on the Endstone mod loader: https://endstone.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

This plugin is packed with various commands that build on BDS while retaining vanilla functionality. There are many optional settings that can be used for a wide variety of servers. A few systems include:
- A punishment system that includes timed, bans, mutes, and logs
- Numerous bug fixes
- Anti-Crasher
- Discord logging
- Vanilla command aliases
- Diagnostic tools to look at server performance & script performance
- An allowlist profile system
- A combat editor

More features will be released in batches alongside large game updates due to my busy schedule. Feel free to make an issue to suggest new ideas!
I currently have on the docket:
- A way to connect scoreboards to the combat edit system
- A better /transfer command
- A way to start & stop the script profiler / likely will be merged with the /viewscriptprofiles command
- OP list command
- General performance improvements
